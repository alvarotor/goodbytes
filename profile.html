        <p>
          I am an energetic professional and a hardworking person with more than
          15 years of experience programming in various fields. I enjoy working
          in a busy environment and being part of a dynamic team that thrives on
          responsibility. I am a self-motivated, curious person and a quick
          learner. I am always excited to learn new skills and discuss various
          methods to achieve goals and objectives. Additionally, I have a good
          sense of humor.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a problem solver with a 'get things done' attitude, passionate
          about creating customer satisfaction, and possess a solid
          understanding of programming principles with strong Business
          Intelligence skills. Technically adept with a high learning ability, I
          am adaptable to any situation. I know when to lead with new ideas and
          have the humility to step back and embrace the good ideas of others. I
          have strong analytical and troubleshooting skills, with a proven
          ability to quickly resolve difficult technical issues. I am always
          ready to learn new programming languages, techniques, practices, or
          frameworks available in the market. Primarily a self-learner, I am an
          expert with many years of experience in solving problems with the
          correct solutions by applying all possible available resources
          throughout the internet, always using SOLID principles and design
          patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
          I consider IT to be my vocation rather than my profession. My
          programming experience is quite broad, including full-stack
          development, mobile applications, software architecture, and cloud
          services.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have extensive experience gained by working in many different areas
          in various types of companies: airlines, music, education, energy,
          telecommunications, sports, clothing, fashion, and hotels, social
          networks, travel, in on-site positions and freelancing as a
          contractor, within startups, small businesses, and large multinational
          consultancies. I have worked as a software architect, team lead
          developer, and senior developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking
          with you and please do not hesitate to contact me if you require
          further information. It would be my pleasure to discuss my potential
          contributions and how I could help work with your processes. If you
          require any additional information, I can always be contacted at the
          email goodbytes23@gmail.com. Please see below my resume for additional
          information about my experience.
        </p>
        <p>Yours Sincerely,</p>
        <p>Alvaro Torres</p>
