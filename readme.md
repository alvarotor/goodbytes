# Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and features a responsive design and a simple navigation menu.

The website includes the following pages:

Index: A brief introduction to myself and my work
Contact: A contact form and my contact information
CV: My curriculum vitae
Projects: A showcase of my projects and achievements
The website also includes a number of images and other assets, which are stored in the content and images directories.

I hope you find my website informative and helpful. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments.
